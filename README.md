# Challenge-4 Code Quiz

## Description

This week‚Äôs challenge was to create a Code Quiz from scratch while implementing different Web APIs.

Up to date this is probably the hardest application I had to make. My JavaScript skills are still pretty weak and traversing the DOM is a concept that I am starting to grasp the more I do it.

The biggest struggle I had was figuring out where to start and how to attempt the next step. I've yet mastered the pseudo coding skill since I tend to trip over my own actions and ideas, but I will work on it. 

I referenced several tutorials online and talked to some classmates to get a better idea on how they set up their project and needless to say there is several ways that I could of approached it but got stumped on simply loading the next question.

Unfortunately the project isn‚Äôt finished and didn‚Äôt get to meet most of the criteria.

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
